# 👋🏼Hi there, my name is Adijat Muhammed-Nuhu   

Welcome to my GitHub space. I hope you get to know a little about me through my work here. 

I'm a Data Analyst with a passion for turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python, and I love creating dashboards that don’t just display numbers, but tell meaningful stories.

I believe every dataset holds a story — a reflection of decisions, behaviors, and hidden questions. My role is to uncover those stories with clarity, empathy, and insight, turning data into meaningful understanding.

### 💡 What I Do  
• Data Analysis & Insights  
• Data Cleaning & Transformation   
• Data Visualization & reporting   
• Business intelligence analysis   

Thanks for stopping by, I’m open to learning, collaboration, growth, and exciting data opportunities ✨
